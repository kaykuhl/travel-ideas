## What I learned

This is my first time working with the ionic framework and I was impressed with all of the features of this mobile-friendly network.  I found the documentation intuitive and easy to use. I hope to use this technology in the future.

During my time at the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp (9/2019 to 3/2020), I have been learning the MERN stack.  I have been building applications using React, but decided to learn Angular for this application.

I referenced the following application to get started: [https://www.positronx.io/build-ionic-firebase-crud-app-with-angular/](https://www.positronx.io/build-ionic-firebase-crud-app-with-angular/)
